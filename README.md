# statistics

Pure [Go](http://www.golang.org) implementation of the GSL Statistics library. See http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Statistics.html

It uses interfaces for the data access. So different data types can be used.
Two datatypes are pre-defined: Float64 and Int64.

Testing 100% pass. Tested on Debian6 32-bit.

### ToDo:
- Benchmarking. The package has been bencharked, but a question arised about this.
